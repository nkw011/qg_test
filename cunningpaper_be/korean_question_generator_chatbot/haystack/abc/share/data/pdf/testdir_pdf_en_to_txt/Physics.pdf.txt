Various examples of physical phenomenaPhysicsPhysics is the natural science that studiesmatter,[a] its fundamental constituents, itsmotion and behavior through space andtime, and the related entities of energyand force.[2] Physics is one of the mostfundamental scientific disciplines, withits main goal being to understand howthe universe behaves.[b][3][4][5] Ascientist who specializes in the field ofphysics is called a physicist.
Physics is one of the oldest academicdisciplines and, through its inclusion ofastronomy, perhaps the oldest.[6] Overmuch of the past two millennia, physics,chemistry, biology, and certain branchesof mathematics were a part of naturalphilosophy, but during the ScientificRevolution in the 17th century thesenatural sciences emerged as uniqueresearch endeavors in their own right.[c]Physics intersects with many interdisciplinary areas of research, such as biophysics and quantum chemistry,and the boundaries of physics are not rigidly defined. New ideas in physics often explain the fundamentalmechanisms studied by other sciences[3] and suggest new avenues of research in these and other academicdisciplines such as mathematics and philosophy.
Advances in physics often enable advances in new technologies. For example, advances in theunderstanding of electromagnetism, solid-state physics, and nuclear physics led directly to the developmentof new products that have dramatically transformed modern-day society, such as television, computers,domestic appliances, and nuclear weapons;[3] advances in thermodynamics led to the development ofindustrialization; and advances in mechanics inspired the development of calculus.
The word "physics" comes from Ancient Greek: φυσική (ἐπιστήμη), romanized: physikḗ (epistḗmē),meaning "knowledge of nature".[8][9][10]Astronomy is one of the oldest natural sciences. Early civilizations dating back before 3000 BCE, such asthe Sumerians, ancient Egyptians, and the Indus Valley Civilisation, had a predictive knowledge and a basicawareness of the motions of the Sun, Moon, and stars. The stars and planets, believed to represent gods,were often worshipped. While the explanations for the observed positions of the stars were oftenHistoryAncient astronomyAncient Egyptian astronomy isevident in monuments like the ceilingof Senemut's tomb from theEighteenth Dynasty of Egypt.

1040), Book of Optics BookI, [6.85], [6.86]. Book II,[3.80] describes his cameraobscura experiments.[18]unscientific and lacking in evidence, these early observations laidthe foundation for later astronomy, as the stars were found totraverse great circles across the sky,[6] which could not explain thepositions of the planets.
According to Asger Aaboe, the origins of Western astronomy canbe found in Mesopotamia, and all Western efforts in the exactsciences are descended from late Babylonian astronomy.[11]Egyptian astronomers left monuments showing knowledge of theconstellations and the motions of the celestial bodies,[12] whileGreek poet Homer wrote of various celestial objects in his Iliad andOdyssey; later Greek astronomers provided names, which are stillused today, for most constellations visible from the NorthernHemisphere.[13]Natural philosophy has its origins in Greece during the Archaic period (650 BCE – 480 BCE), when pre-Socratic philosophers like Thales rejected non-naturalistic explanations for natural phenomena andproclaimed that every event had a natural cause.[14] They proposed ideas verified by reason andobservation, and many of their hypotheses proved successful in experiment;[15] for example, atomism wasfound to be correct approximately 2000 years after it was proposed by Leucippus and his pupilDemocritus.[16]The Western Roman Empire fell in the fifth century, and this resulted in a decline in intellectual pursuits inthe western part of Europe. By contrast, the Eastern Roman Empire (also known as the Byzantine Empire)resisted the attacks from the barbarians, and continued to advance various fields of learning, includingphysics.[17]In the sixth century, Isidore of Miletus created an important compilation of Archimedes' works that arecopied in the Archimedes Palimpsest.
In sixth-century Europe John Philoponus, a Byzantine scholar, questionedAristotle's teaching of physics and noted its flaws. He introduced the theoryof impetus. Aristotle's physics was not scrutinized until Philoponusappeared; unlike Aristotle, who based his physics on verbal argument,Philoponus relied on observation. On Aristotle's physics Philoponus wrote:But this is completely erroneous, and our view may becorroborated by actual observation more effectively than byany sort of verbal argument. For if you let fall from the sameheight two weights of which one is many times as heavy as theother, you will see that the ratio of the times required for themotion does not depend on the ratio of the weights, but that thedifference in time is a very small one. And so, if the differencein the weights is not considerable, that is, of one is, let us say,double the other, there will be no difference, or else anNatural philosophyMedieval European and Islamicimperceptible difference, in time, though the difference in weight is with one body weighing twice as much as the other[19]Philoponus' criticism of Aristotelian principles of physics served as an inspiration for Galileo Galilei tencenturies later,[20] during the Scientific Revolution. Galileo cited Philoponus substantially in his workswhen arguing that Aristotelian physics was flawed.[21][22] In the 1300s Jean Buridan, a teacher in thefaculty of arts at the University of Paris, developed the concept of impetus. It was a step toward the modernideas of inertia and momentum.[23]Islamic scholarship inherited Aristotelian physics from the Greeks and during the Islamic Golden Agedeveloped it further, especially placing emphasis on observation and a priori reasoning, developing earlyforms of the scientific method.
Although Aristotle’s principles of physics was criticized, it is important to identify his the evidence he basedhis views off of.  When thinking of the history of science and math, it is notable to acknowledge thecontributions made by older scientists. Aristotle’s science was the backbone of the science we learn inschools today. Aristotle published many biological works including The Parts of Animals, in which hediscusses both biological science and natural science as well. It is also integral to mention the role Aristotlehad in the progression of physics and metaphysics and how his beliefs and findings are still being taught inscience classes to this day. The explanations that Aristotle gives for his findings are also very simple. Whenthinking of the elements, Aristotle believed that each element (earth, fire, water, air) had its own naturalplace (https://www.calstatela.edu/sites/default/files/dept/chem/09summer/158/daily40-aristotle.pdf).
Meaning that because of the density of these elements, they will revert back to their own specific place inthe atmosphere.[24] So, because of their weights, fire would be at the very top, air right underneath fire, thenwater, then lastly earth. He also stated that when a small amount of one element enters the natural place ofanother, the less abundant element will automatically go into its own natural place. For example, if there is afire on the ground, if you pay attention, the flames go straight up into the air as an attempt to go back into itsnatural place where it belongs. Aristotle called his metaphysics “first philosophy” and characterized it as thestudy of “being as being”.[25] Aristotle defined the paradigm of motion as a being or entity encompassingdifferent areas in the same body. [25]Meaning that if a person is at a certain location (A) they can move to anew location (B) and still take up the same amount of space. This is involved with Aristotle’s belief thatmotion is a continuum. In terms of matter, Aristotle believed that the change in category (ex. place) andquality (ex. color) of an object is defined as “alteration”. But, a change in substance is a change in matter.
This is also very close to our idea of matter today.
He also devised his own laws of motion that include 1) heavier objects will fall faster, the speed beingproportional to the weight and 2) the speed of the object that is falling depends inversely on the densityobject it is falling through (ex. density of air).[26] He also stated that, when it comes to violent motion(motion of an object when a force is applied to it by a second object) that the speed that object moves, willonly be as fast or strong as the measure of force applied to it.[26] This is also seen in the rules of velocityand force that is taught in physics classes today. These rules are not necessarily what we see in our physicstoday but, they are very similar. It is evident that these rules were the backbone for other scientists to comerevise and edit his beliefs.
The most notable innovations were in the field of optics and vision, which came from the works of manyscientists like Ibn Sahl, Al-Kindi, Ibn al-Haytham, Al-Farisi and Avicenna. The most notable work was TheBook of Optics (also known as Kitāb al-Manāẓir), written by Ibn al-Haytham, in which he conclusivelydisproved the ancient Greek idea about vision and came up with a new theory. In the book, he presented astudy of the phenomenon of the camera obscura (his thousand-year-old version of the pinhole camera) anddelved further into the way the eye itself works. Using dissections and the knowledge of previous scholars,The basic way a pinholecamera worksGalileo Galilei (1564–1642)showed a modernappreciation for the properrelationship betweenmathematics, theoreticalphysics, and experimentalphysics.
he was able to begin to explain how light enters the eye. He asserted thatthe light ray is focused, but the actual explanation of how light projected tothe back of the eye had to wait until 1604. His Treatise on Light explainedthe camera obscura, hundreds of years before the modern development ofphotography.[27]The seven-volume Book of Optics (Kitab al-Manathir) hugely influencedthinking across disciplines from the theory of visual perception to the natureof perspective in medieval art, in both the East and the West, for more than600 years. Many later European scholars and fellow polymaths, fromRobert Grosseteste and Leonardo da Vinci to René Descartes, JohannesKepler and Isaac Newton, were in his debt. Indeed, the influence of Ibn al-Haytham's Optics ranksalongside that of Newton's work of the same title, published 700 years later.
The translation of The Book of Optics had a huge impact on Europe. From it, later European scholars wereable to build devices that replicated those Ibn al-Haytham had built and understand the way light works.
From this, important inventions such as eyeglasses, magnifying glasses, telescopes, and cameras weredeveloped.
Physics became a separate science when early modern Europeans usedexperimental and quantitative methods to discover what are now consideredto be the laws of physics.[28]Major developments in this period include the replacement of the geocentricmodel of the Solar System with the heliocentric Copernican model, the lawsgoverning the motion of planetary bodies (determined by Kepler between1609 and 1619), Galileo's pioneering work on telescopes and observationalastronomy in the 16th and 17th Centuries, and Isaac Newton's discoveryand unification of the laws of motion and universal gravitation (that wouldcome to bear his name).[29] Newton also developed calculus,[d] themathematical study of continuous change, which provided newmathematical methods for solving physical problems.[30]The discovery of new laws in thermodynamics, chemistry, andelectromagnetics resulted from research efforts during the IndustrialRevolution as energy needs increased.[31] The laws comprising classicalphysics remain very widely used for objects on everyday scales travelling atnon-relativistic speeds, since they provide a very close approximation insuch situations, and theories such as quantum mechanics and the theory ofrelativity simplify to their classical equivalents at such scales. Inaccuracies in classical mechanics for verysmall objects and very high velocities led to the development of modern physics in the 20th century.
Modern physics began in the early 20th century with the work of Max Planck in quantum theory and AlbertEinstein's theory of relativity. Both of these theories came about due to inaccuracies in classical mechanicsin certain situations. Classical mechanics predicted that the speed of light depends on the motion of theobserver, which could not be resolved with the constant speed predicted by Maxwell's equations ofelectromagnetism. This discrepancy was corrected by Einstein's theory of special relativity, which replacedClassicalModernSir Isaac Newton (1643–1727), whose laws of motionand universal gravitationwere major milestones inclassical physicsMax Planck (1858–1947),the originator of the theoryof quantum mechanicsclassical mechanics for fast-moving bodies and allowed for a constant speedof light.[32] Black-body radiation provided another problem for classicalphysics, which was corrected when Planck proposed that the excitation ofmaterial oscillators is possible only in discrete steps proportional to theirfrequency. This, along with the photoelectric effect and a complete theorypredicting discrete energy levels of electron orbitals, led to the theory ofquantum mechanics improving on classical physics at very small scales.[33]Quantum mechanics would come to be pioneered by Werner Heisenberg,Erwin Schrödinger and Paul Dirac.[33] From this early work, and work inrelated fields, the Standard Model of particle physics was derived.[34]Following the discovery of a particle with properties consistent with theHiggs boson at CERN in 2012,[35] all fundamental particles predicted bythe standard model, and no others, appear to exist; however, physicsbeyond the Standard Model, with theories such as supersymmetry, is anactive area of research.[36] Areas of mathematics in general are important tothis field, such as the study of probabilities and groups.
In many ways, physics stems from ancient Greek philosophy. From Thales'first attempt to characterize matter, to Democritus' deduction that matterought to reduce to an invariant state the Ptolemaic astronomy of acrystalline firmament, and Aristotle's book Physics (an early book onphysics, which attempted to analyze and define motion from a philosophicalpoint of view), various Greek philosophers advanced their own theories ofnature. Physics was known as natural philosophy until the late 18thcentury.[e]By the 19th century, physics was realized as a discipline distinct fromphilosophy and the other sciences. Physics, as with the rest of science, relieson philosophy of science and its "scientific method" to advance ourknowledge of the physical world.[38] The scientific method employs apriori reasoning as well as a posteriori reasoning and the use of Bayesianinference to measure the validity of a given theory.[39]The development of physics has answered many questions of earlyphilosophers but has also raised new questions. Study of the philosophical issues surrounding physics, thephilosophy of physics, involves issues such as the nature of space and time, determinism, and metaphysicaloutlooks such as empiricism, naturalism and realism.[40]Many physicists have written about the philosophical implications of their work, for instance Laplace, whochampioned causal determinism,[41] and Erwin Schrödinger, who wrote on quantum mechanics.[42][43] Themathematical physicist Roger Penrose has been called a Platonist by Stephen Hawking,[44] a view Penrosediscusses in his book, The Road to Reality.[45] Hawking referred to himself as an "unashamed reductionist"and took issue with Penrose's views.[46]PhilosophyCore theoriesAlbert Einstein (1879–1955),whose work on thephotoelectric effect and thetheory of relativity led to arevolution in 20th centuryphysicsThough physics deals with a wide variety of systems, certain theories areused by all physicists. Each of these theories was experimentally testednumerous times and found to be an adequate approximation of nature. Forinstance, the theory of classical mechanics accurately describes the motionof objects, provided they are much larger than atoms and moving at a speedmuch less than the speed of light. These theories continue to be areas ofactive research today. Chaos theory, a remarkable aspect of classicalmechanics, was discovered in the 20th century, three centuries after theoriginal formulation of classical mechanics by Newton (1642–1727).
These central theories are important tools for research into more specializedtopics, and any physicist, regardless of their specialization, is expected to beliterate in them. These include classical mechanics, quantum mechanics,thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, electromagnetism, and specialrelativity.
Classical physics includes the traditional branches and topics that wererecognized and well-developed before the beginning of the 20th century—classical mechanics, acoustics,optics, thermodynamics, and electromagnetism. Classical mechanics is concerned with bodies acted on byforces and bodies in motion and may be divided into statics (study of the forces on a body or bodies notsubject to an acceleration), kinematics (study of motion without regard to its causes), and dynamics (studyof motion and the forces that affect it); mechanics may also be divided into solid mechanics and fluidmechanics (known together as continuum mechanics), the latter include such branches as hydrostatics,hydrodynamics, aerodynamics, and pneumatics. Acoustics is the study of how sound is produced,controlled, transmitted and received.[47] Important modern branches of acoustics include ultrasonics, thestudy of sound waves of very high frequency beyond the range of human hearing; bioacoustics, the physicsof animal calls and hearing,[48] and electroacoustics, the manipulation of audible sound waves usingelectronics.[49]Optics, the study of light, is concerned not only with visible light but also with infrared and ultravioletradiation, which exhibit all of the phenomena of visible light except visibility, e.g., reflection, refraction,interference, diffraction, dispersion, and polarization of light. Heat is a form of energy, the internal energypossessed by the particles of which a substance is composed; thermodynamics deals with the relationshipsbetween heat and other forms of energy. Electricity and magnetism have been studied as a single branch ofphysics since the intimate connection between them was discovered in the early 19th century; an electriccurrent gives rise to a magnetic field, and a changing magnetic field induces an electric current.
Electrostatics deals with electric charges at rest, electrodynamics with moving charges, and magnetostaticswith magnetic poles at rest.
Classical physics is generally concerned with matter and energy on the normal scale of observation, whilemuch of modern physics is concerned with the behavior of matter and energy under extreme conditions oron a very large or very small scale. For example, atomic and nuclear physics study matter on the smallestscale at which chemical elements can be identified. The physics of elementary particles is on an evensmaller scale since it is concerned with the most basic units of matter; this branch of physics is also knownClassicalModernThe basic domains of physicsSolvay Conference of 1927, withprominent physicists such as AlbertEinstein, Werner Heisenberg, MaxPlanck, Hendrik Lorentz, Niels Bohr,Marie Curie, Erwin Schrödinger andPaul Diracas high-energy physics because of the extremely high energies necessary to produce many types of particlesin particle accelerators. On this scale, ordinary, commonsensical notions of space, time, matter, and energyare no longer valid.[50]The two chief theories of modern physics present a different picture of the concepts of space, time, andmatter from that presented by classical physics. Classical mechanics approximates nature as continuous,while quantum theory is concerned with the discrete nature of many phenomena at the atomic andsubatomic level and with the complementary aspects of particles and waves in the description of suchphenomena. The theory of relativity is concerned with the description of phenomena that take place in aframe of reference that is in motion with respect to an observer; the special theory of relativity is concernedwith motion in the absence of gravitational fields and the general theory of relativity with motion and itsconnection with gravitation. Both quantum theory and the theory of relativity find applications in manyareas of modern physics.[51]CausalityCovarianceActionPhysical fieldSymmetryPhysical interactionStatistical ensembleQuantumWaveParticleWhile physics aims to discover universal laws, itstheories lie in explicit domains of applicability.
Loosely speaking, the laws of classical physics accurately describesystems whose important length scales are greater than the atomicscale and whose motions are much slower than the speed of light.
Outside of this domain, observations do not match predictionsprovided by classical mechanics. Einstein contributed theframework of special relativity, which replaced notions of absolutetime and space with spacetime and allowed an accurate descriptionof systems whose components have speeds approaching the speedof light. Planck, Schrödinger, and others introduced quantummechanics, a probabilistic notion of particles and interactions thatFundamental concepts in modern physicsDifferenceThis parabola-shaped lava flowillustrates the application ofmathematics in physics—in thiscase, Galileo's law of falling bodies.

allowed an accurate description of atomic and subatomic scales. Later, quantum field theory unifiedquantum mechanics and special relativity. General relativity allowed for a dynamical, curved spacetime,with which highly massive systems and the large-scale structure of the universe can be well-described.
General relativity has not yet been unified with the other fundamental descriptions; several candidatetheories of quantum gravity are being developed.
Mathematics provides a compact and exactlanguage used to describe the order in nature.
This was noted and advocated byPythagoras,[52] Plato,[53] Galileo,[54] andNewton.
Physics uses mathematics[55] to organise andformulate experimental results. From thoseresults, precise or estimated solutions areobtained, or quantitative results, from whichnew predictions can be made andexperimentally confirmed or negated. The results from physics experiments arenumerical data, with their units of measure and estimates of the errors in themeasurements. Technologies based on mathematics, like computation have madecomputational physics an active area of research.
Ontology is a prerequisite for physics, but notfor mathematics. It means physics is ultimatelyconcerned with descriptions of the real world,while mathematics is concerned with abstractpatterns, even beyond the real world. Thusphysics statements are synthetic, whilemathematical statements are analytic.
Mathematics contains hypotheses, whilephysics contains theories. Mathematics statements have to be onlylogically true, while predictions of physics statements must matchobserved and experimental data.
The distinction is clear-cut, but not always obvious. For example,mathematical physics is the application of mathematics in physics.
Its methods are mathematical, but its subject is physical.[56] Theproblems in this field start with a "mathematical model of a physical situation" (system) and a "mathematicaldescription of a physical law" that will be applied to that system. Every mathematical statement used forsolving has a hard-to-find physical meaning. The final mathematical solution has an easier-to-find meaning,because it is what the solver is looking for.
Pure physics is a branch of fundamental science (also called basic science). Physics is also called "thefundamental science" because all branches of natural science like chemistry, astronomy, geology, andbiology are constrained by laws of physics.[57] Similarly, chemistry is often called the central sciencebecause of its role in linking the physical sciences. For example, chemistry studies properties, structures,and reactions of matter (chemistry's focus on the molecular and atomic scale distinguishes it from physics).
Relation to other fieldsPrerequisitesClassical physicsimplemented in an acousticengineering model of soundreflecting from an acousticdiffuserArchimedes' screw, a simplemachine for liftingExperiment using a laserStructures are formed because particles exert electrical forces on each other, properties include physicalcharacteristics of given substances, and reactions are bound by laws of physics, like conservation of energy,mass, and charge. Physics is applied in industries like engineering and medicine.
Applied physics is a general term forphysics research, which is intended for aparticular use. An applied physicscurriculum usually contains a few classes inan applied discipline, like geology orelectrical engineering. It usually differs fromengineering in that an applied physicist maynot be designing something in particular,but rather is using physics or conductingphysics research with the aim ofdeveloping new technologies orsolving a problem.
The approach is similar to that ofapplied mathematics. Appliedphysicists use physics in scientificresearch. For instance, peopleworking on accelerator physicsmight seek to build better particledetectors for research in theoreticalphysics.
Physics is used heavily in engineering. For example, statics, a subfield of mechanics, is used in the buildingof bridges and other static structures. The understanding and use of acoustics results in sound control andbetter concert halls; similarly, the use of optics creates better optical devices. An understanding of physicsmakes for more realistic flight simulators, video games, and movies, and is often critical in forensicinvestigations.
With the standard consensus that the laws of physics are universal and do not change with time, physics canbe used to study things that would ordinarily be mired in uncertainty. For example, in the study of the originof the earth, one can reasonably model earth's mass, temperature, and rate of rotation, as a function of timeallowing one to extrapolate forward or backward in time and so predict future or prior events. It also allowsfor simulations in engineering that drastically speed up the development of a new technology.
But there is also considerable interdisciplinarity, so many other important fields are influenced by physics(e.g., the fields of econophysics and sociophysics).
Physicists use the scientific method to test the validity of a physical theory. By using a methodical approachto compare the implications of a theory with the conclusions drawn from its related experiments andobservations, physicists are better able to test the validity of a theory in a logical, unbiased, and repeatableApplication and influenceResearchScientific methodThe astronaut and Earth are both infree fall.

way. To that end, experiments are performed and observations are made in order to determine the validity orinvalidity of the theory.[58]A scientific law is a concise verbal or mathematical statement of a relation that expresses a fundamentalprinciple of some theory, such as Newton's law of universal gravitation.[59]Theorists seek to develop mathematical models that both agree withexisting experiments and successfully predict future experimentalresults, while experimentalists devise and perform experiments totest theoretical predictions and explore new phenomena. Althoughtheory and experiment are developed separately, they strongly affectand depend upon each other. Progress in physics frequently comesabout when experimental results defy explanation by existingtheories, prompting intense focus on applicable modelling, andwhen new theories generate experimentally testable predictions,which inspire the development of new experiments (and oftenrelated equipment).[60]Physicists who work at the interplay of theory and experiment arecalled phenomenologists, who study complex phenomena observedin experiment and work to relate them to a fundamental theory.[61]Theoretical physics has historically taken inspiration fromphilosophy; electromagnetism was unified this way.[f] Beyond theknown universe, the field of theoretical physics also deals withhypothetical issues,[g] such as parallel universes, a multiverse, andhigher dimensions. Theorists invoke these ideas in hopes of solvingparticular problems with existing theories; they then explore theconsequences of these ideas and work toward making testablepredictions.
Experimental physics expands, and is expanded by, engineeringand technology. Experimental physicists who are involved in basicresearch design and perform experiments with equipment such asparticle accelerators and lasers, whereas those involved in appliedresearch often work in industry, developing technologies such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) andtransistors. Feynman has noted that experimentalists may seek areas that have not been explored well bytheorists.[62]Physics covers a wide range of phenomena, from elementary particles (such as quarks, neutrinos, andelectrons) to the largest superclusters of galaxies. Included in these phenomena are the most basic objectscomposing all other things. Therefore, physics is sometimes called the "fundamental science".[57] Physicsaims to describe the various phenomena that occur in nature in terms of simpler phenomena. Thus, physicsaims to both connect the things observable to humans to root causes, and then connect these causestogether.
Theory and experimentScope and aimsPhysics involves modeling thenatural world with theory, usuallyquantitative. Here, the path of aparticle is modeled with themathematics of calculus to explainits behavior: the purview of thebranch of physics known asmechanics.
For example, the ancient Chinese observed that certain rocks(lodestone and magnetite) were attracted to one another by aninvisible force. This effect was later called magnetism, which wasfirst rigorously studied in the 17th century. But even before theChinese discovered magnetism, the ancient Greeks knew of otherobjects such as amber, that when rubbed with fur would cause asimilar invisible attraction between the two.[63] This was also firststudied rigorously in the 17th century and came to be calledelectricity. Thus, physics had come to understand two observationsof nature in terms of some root cause (electricity and magnetism).
However, further work in the 19th century revealed that these twoforces were just two different aspects of one force—electromagnetism. This process of "unifying" forces continuestoday, and electromagnetism and the weak nuclear force are nowconsidered to be two aspects of the electroweak interaction. Physicshopes to find an ultimate reason (theory of everything) for whynature is as it is (see section Current research below for moreinformation).[64]Contemporary research in physics can be broadly divided into nuclear and particle physics; condensedmatter physics; atomic, molecular, and optical physics; astrophysics; and applied physics. Some physicsdepartments also support physics education research and physics outreach.[65]Since the 20th century, the individual fields of physics have become increasingly specialised, and todaymost physicists work in a single field for their entire careers. "Universalists" such as Einstein (1879–1955)and Lev Landau (1908–1968), who worked in multiple fields of physics, are now very rare.[h]The major fields of physics, along with their subfields and the theories and concepts they employ, areshown in the following table.

The field is also called "high-energyphysics" because many elementary particles do not occur naturally but are created only during high-energycollisions of other particles.[70]Currently, the interactions of elementary particles and fields are described by the Standard Model.[71] Themodel accounts for the 12 known particles of matter (quarks and leptons) that interact via the strong, weak,and electromagnetic fundamental forces.[71] Dynamics are described in terms of matter particles exchanginggauge bosons (gluons, W and Z bosons, and photons, respectively).[72] The Standard Model also predicts aparticle known as the Higgs boson.[71] In July 2012 CERN, the European laboratory for particle physics,announced the detection of a particle consistent with the Higgs boson,[73] an integral part of the Higgsmechanism.

The most commonly knownapplications of nuclear physics are nuclear power generation andnuclear weapons technology, but the research has providedapplication in many fields, including those in nuclear medicine andmagnetic resonance imaging, ion implantation in materialsengineering, and radiocarbon dating in geology and archaeology.
Atomic, molecular, and optical physics (AMO) is the study ofmatter–matter and light–matter interactions on the scale of singleatoms and molecules. The three areas are grouped together becauseof their interrelationships, the similarity of methods used, and thecommonality of their relevant energy scales. All three areas includeboth classical, semi-classical and quantum treatments; they can treattheir subject from a microscopic view (in contrast to a macroscopicview).
Atomic physics studies the electron shells of atoms. Current research focuses on activities in quantumcontrol, cooling and trapping of atoms and ions,[74][75][76] low-temperature collision dynamics and theeffects of electron correlation on structure and dynamics. Atomic physics is influenced by the nucleus (seehyperfine splitting), but intra-nuclear phenomena such as fission and fusion are considered part of nuclearphysics.
Molecular physics focuses on multi-atomic structures and their internal and external interactions with matterand light. Optical physics is distinct from optics in that it tends to focus not on the control of classical lightfields by macroscopic objects but on the fundamental properties of optical fields and their interactions withmatter in the microscopic realm.
Condensed matter physics is the field of physics that dealswith the macroscopic physical properties of matter.[77][78]In particular, it is concerned with the "condensed" phasesthat appear whenever the number of particles in a systemis extremely large and the interactions between them arestrong.[79]The most familiar examples of condensed phases aresolids and liquids, which arise from the bonding by wayof the electromagnetic force between atoms.[80] Moreexotic condensed phases include the superfluid[81] and theBose–Einstein condensate[82] found in certain atomicsystems at very low temperature, the superconductingphase exhibited by conduction electrons in certainmaterials,[83] and the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases of spins on atomic lattices.[84]Condensed matter physics is the largest field of contemporary physics. Historically, condensed matterphysics grew out of solid-state physics, which is now considered one of its main subfields.[85] The termcondensed matter physics was apparently coined by Philip Anderson when he renamed his research groupAtomic, molecular, and opticalCondensed matterThe deepest visible-light image ofthe universe, the Hubble Ultra-DeepField—previously solid-state theory—in 1967.[86] In 1978, the Division of Solid State Physics of the AmericanPhysical Society was renamed as the Division of Condensed Matter Physics.[85] Condensed matter physicshas a large overlap with chemistry, materials science, nanotechnology and engineering.[79]Astrophysics and astronomy are the application of the theories andmethods of physics to the study of stellar structure, stellar evolution,the origin of the Solar System, and related problems of cosmology.
Because astrophysics is a broad subject, astrophysicists typicallyapply many disciplines of physics, including mechanics,electromagnetism, statistical mechanics, thermodynamics, quantummechanics, relativity, nuclear and particle physics, and atomic andmolecular physics.[87]The discovery by Karl Jansky in 1931 that radio signals wereemitted by celestial bodies initiated the science of radio astronomy.
Most recently, the frontiers of astronomy have been expanded byspace exploration. Perturbations and interference from the earth'satmosphere make space-based observations necessary for infrared,ultraviolet, gamma-ray, and X-ray astronomy.
Physical cosmology is the study of the formation and evolution of the universe on its largest scales. AlbertEinstein's theory of relativity plays a central role in all modern cosmological theories. In the early 20thcentury, Hubble's discovery that the universe is expanding, as shown by the Hubble diagram, promptedrival explanations known as the steady state universe and the Big Bang.
The Big Bang was confirmed by the success of Big Bang nucleosynthesis and the discovery of the cosmicmicrowave background in 1964. The Big Bang model rests on two theoretical pillars: Albert Einstein'sgeneral relativity and the cosmological principle. Cosmologists have recently established the ΛCDM modelof the evolution of the universe, which includes cosmic inflation, dark energy, and dark matter.
Numerous possibilities and discoveries are anticipated to emerge from new data from the Fermi Gamma-raySpace Telescope over the upcoming decade and vastly revise or clarify existing models of theuniverse.[88][89] In particular, the potential for a tremendous discovery surrounding dark matter is possibleover the next several years.[90] Fermi will search for evidence that dark matter is composed of weaklyinteracting massive particles, complementing similar experiments with the Large Hadron Collider and otherunderground detectors.
IBEX is already yielding new astrophysical discoveries: "No one knows what is creating the ENA(energetic neutral atoms) ribbon" along the termination shock of the solar wind, "but everyone agrees that itmeans the textbook picture of the heliosphere—in which the Solar System's enveloping pocket filled withthe solar wind's charged particles is plowing through the onrushing 'galactic wind' of the interstellar mediumin the shape of a comet—is wrong."[91]Research in physics is continually progressing on a large number of fronts.

In condensed matter physics, an important unsolved theoreticalproblem is that of high-temperature superconductivity.[92] Manycondensed matter experiments are aiming to fabricate workablespintronics and quantum computers.[79][93]In particle physics, the first pieces of experimental evidence forphysics beyond the Standard Model have begun to appear.
Foremost among these are indications that neutrinos have non-zeromass. These experimental results appear to have solved the long-standing solar neutrino problem, and the physics of massiveneutrinos remains an area of active theoretical and experimentalresearch. The Large Hadron Collider has already found the Higgsboson, but future research aims to prove or disprove thesupersymmetry, which extends the Standard Model of particlephysics. Research on the nature of the major mysteries of darkmatter and dark energy is also currently ongoing.[94]Although much progress has been made in high-energy, quantum,and astronomical physics, many everyday phenomena involvingcomplexity,[95] chaos,[96] or turbulence[97] are still poorlyunderstood. Complex problems that seem like they could be solvedby a clever application of dynamics and mechanics remainunsolved; examples include the formation of sandpiles, nodes intrickling water, the shape of water droplets, mechanisms of surfacetension catastrophes, and self-sorting in shaken heterogeneouscollections.[i][98]These complex phenomena have received growing attention since the 1970s for several reasons, includingthe availability of modern mathematical methods and computers, which enabled complex systems to bemodeled in new ways. Complex physics has become part of increasingly interdisciplinary research, asexemplified by the study of turbulence in aerodynamics and the observation of pattern formation inbiological systems. In the 1932 Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics, Horace Lamb said:[99]I am an old man now, and when I die and go to heaven there are two matters on which I hopefor enlightenment. One is quantum electrodynamics, and the other is the turbulent motion offluids. And about the former I am rather optimistic.

At the start of The Feynman Lectures on Physics, Richard Feynman offers the atomichypothesis as the single most prolific scientific concept.[1]b. The term "universe" is defined as everything that physically exists: the entirety of space andtime, all forms of matter, energy and momentum, and the physical laws and constants thatgovern them. However, the term "universe" may also be used in slightly different contextualsenses, denoting concepts such as the cosmos or the philosophical world.
c. Francis Bacon's 1620 Novum Organum was critical in the development of scientificmethod.[7]d. Calculus was independently developed at around the same time by Gottfried WilhelmLeibniz; while Leibniz was the first to publish his work and develop much of the notationused for calculus today, Newton was the first to develop calculus and apply it to physicalproblems. See also Leibniz–Newton calculus controversye. Noll notes that some universities still use this title.[37]f. See, for example, the influence of Kant and Ritter on Ørsted.
g. Concepts which are denoted hypothetical can change with time. For example, the atom ofnineteenth-century physics was denigrated by some, including Ernst Mach's critique ofLudwig Boltzmann's formulation of statistical mechanics. By the end of World War II, theatom was no longer deemed hypothetical.
h. Yet, universalism is encouraged in the culture of physics. For example, the World Wide Web,which was innovated at CERN by Tim Berners-Lee, was created in service to the computerinfrastructure of CERN, and was/is intended for use by physicists worldwide. The samemight be said for arXiv.orgi. See the work of Ilya Prigogine, on 'systems far from equilibrium', and others.

Scientists of all disciplines use the ideas of physics, including chemists who study thestructure of molecules, paleontologists who try to reconstruct how dinosaurs walked, andclimatologists who study how human activities affect the atmosphere and oceans. Physics isalso the foundation of all engineering and technology.

And as tothe first, I greatly doubt that Aristotle ever tested by experiment whether it be true that twostones, one weighing ten times as much as the other, if allowed to fall, at the same instant,from a height of, say, 100 cubits, would so differ in speed that when the heavier had reachedthe ground, the other would not have fallen more than 10 cubits.
Simp. - His language would seem to indicate that he had tried the experiment, because hesays: We see the heavier; now the word see shows that he had made the experiment.
Sagr. - But I, Simplicio, who have made the test can assure[107] you that a cannon ballweighing one or two hundred pounds, or even more, will not reach the ground by as much asa span ahead of a musket ball weighing only half a pound, provided both are dropped from aheight of 200 cubits."21.
