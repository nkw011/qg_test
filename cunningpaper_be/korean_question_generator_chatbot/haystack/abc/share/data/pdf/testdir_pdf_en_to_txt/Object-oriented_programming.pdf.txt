This Button class hasvariables for data, andfunctions. Throughinheritance a subclass canbe created as subset ofthe Button class. Objectsare instances of a class.
I thought of objects being like biological cellsand/or individual computers on a network, onlyable to communicate with messages (soObject-oriented programmingObject-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects",which can contain data and code. The data is in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties),and the code is in the form of procedures (often known as methods).
A common feature of objects is that procedures (or methods) are attached to them and can access andmodify the object's data fields. In this brand of OOP, there is usually a special name such as this or selfused to refer to the current object. In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objectsthat interact with one another.[1][2] OOP languages are diverse, but the most popular ones are class-based,meaning that objects are instances of classes, which also determine their types.
Many of the most widely used programming languages (such as C++, Java, Python, etc.) are multi-paradigm and they support object-oriented programming to a greater or lesser degree, typically incombination with imperative, procedural programming.
Significant object-oriented languages include: Ada, ActionScript, C++, Common Lisp, C#, Dart, Eiffel,Fortran 2003, Haxe, Java, JavaScript, Kotlin, logo, MATLAB, Objective-C, Object Pascal, Perl, PHP,Python, R, Raku, Ruby, Scala, SIMSCRIPT, Simula, Smalltalk, Swift, Vala and Visual Basic.NET.
Terminology invoking "objects" and "oriented" in the modern sense ofobject-oriented programming made its first appearance at MIT in the late1950s and early 1960s. In the environment of the artificial intelligence group,as early as 1960, "object" could refer to identified items (LISP atoms) withproperties (attributes);[3][4] Alan Kay later cited a detailed understanding ofLISP internals as a strong influence on his thinking in 1966.[5]Another early MIT example was Sketchpad created by Ivan Sutherland in1960–1961; in the glossary of the 1963 technical report based on hisdissertation about Sketchpad, Sutherland defined notions of "object" and"instance" (with the class concept covered by "master" or "definition"), albeitspecialized to graphical interaction.[6] Also, an MIT ALGOL version, AED-0, established a direct link between data structures ("plexes", in that dialect)and procedures, prefiguring what were later termed "messages", "methods",and "member functions".[7][8]Simula introduced important concepts that are today an essential part ofobject-oriented programming, such as class and object, inheritance, anddynamic binding.[9] The object-oriented Simula programming language wasused mainly by researchers involved with physical modelling, such as modelsto study and improve the movement of ships andtheir content through cargo ports.[9]Historymessaging came at the very beginning – it took awhile to see how to do messaging in aprogramming language efficiently enough to beuseful).

In the 1970s, the first version of the Smalltalkprogramming language was developed at XeroxPARC by Alan Kay, Dan Ingalls and AdeleGoldberg. Smalltalk-72 included a programmingenvironment and was dynamically typed, and atfirst was interpreted, not compiled. Smalltalkbecame noted for its application of objectorientation at the language-level and its graphicaldevelopment environment. Smalltalk went throughvarious versions and interest in the language grew.[10] While Smalltalk was influenced by the ideasintroduced in Simula 67 it was designed to be a fully dynamic system in which classes could be created andmodified dynamically.[11]In the 1970s, Smalltalk influenced the Lisp community to incorporate object-based techniques that wereintroduced to developers via the Lisp machine. Experimentation with various extensions to Lisp (such asLOOPS and Flavors introducing multiple inheritance and mixins) eventually led to the Common LispObject System, which integrates functional programming and object-oriented programming and allowsextension via a Meta-object protocol. In the 1980s, there were a few attempts to design processorarchitectures that included hardware support for objects in memory but these were not successful. Examplesinclude the Intel iAPX 432 and the Linn Smart Rekursiv.
In 1981, Goldberg edited the August issue of Byte Magazine, introducing Smalltalk and object-orientedprogramming to a wider audience. In 1986, the Association for Computing Machinery organised the firstConference on Object-Oriented Programming, Systems, Languages, and Applications (OOPSLA), whichwas unexpectedly attended by 1,000 people. In the mid-1980s Objective-C was developed by Brad Cox,who had used Smalltalk at ITT Inc., and Bjarne Stroustrup, who had used Simula for his PhD thesis,eventually went to create the object-oriented C++.[10] In 1985, Bertrand Meyer also produced the firstdesign of the Eiffel language. Focused on software quality, Eiffel is a purely object-oriented programminglanguage and a notation supporting the entire software lifecycle. Meyer described the Eiffel softwaredevelopment method, based on a small number of key ideas from software engineering and computerscience, in Object-Oriented Software Construction. Essential to the quality focus of Eiffel is Meyer'sreliability mechanism, Design by Contract, which is an integral part of both the method and language.
In the early and mid-1990s object-orientedprogramming developed as the dominantprogramming paradigm when programminglanguages supporting the techniques becamewidely available. These included VisualFoxPro 3.0,[12][13][14] C++,[15] and Delphi. Itsdominance was further enhanced by the risingpopularity of graphical user interfaces, whichrely heavily upon object-oriented programmingtechniques. An example of a closely relateddynamic GUI library and OOP language canbe found in the Cocoa frameworks on Mac OSX, written in Objective-C, an object-oriented,dynamic messaging extension to C based onSmalltalk. OOP toolkits also enhanced thepopularity of event-driven programming(although this concept is not limited to OOP).
At ETH Zürich, Niklaus Wirth and his colleagues had also been investigating such topics as dataabstraction and modular programming (although this had been in common use in the 1960s or earlier).
Modula-2 (1978) included both, and their succeeding design, Oberon, included a distinctive approach toobject orientation, classes, and such.
Object-oriented features have been added to many previously existing languages, including Ada, BASIC,Fortran, Pascal, and COBOL. Adding these features to languages that were not initially designed for themoften led to problems with compatibility and maintainability of code.
More recently, a number of languages have emerged that are primarily object-oriented, but that are alsocompatible with procedural methodology. Two such languages are Python and Ruby. Probably the mostcommercially important recent object-oriented languages are Java, developed by Sun Microsystems, as wellas C# and Visual Basic.NET (VB.NET), both designed for Microsoft's .NET platform. Each of these twoframeworks shows, in its own way, the benefit of using OOP by creating an abstraction fromimplementation. VB.NET and C# support cross-language inheritance, allowing classes defined in onelanguage to subclass classes defined in the other language.
Object-oriented programming uses objects, but not all of the associated techniques and structures aresupported directly in languages that claim to support OOP. It performs operations on operands. The featureslisted below are common among languages considered to be strongly class- and object-oriented (or multi-paradigm with OOP support), with notable exceptions mentioned.[16][17][18][19]Variables that can store information formatted in a small number of built-in data types likeintegers and alphanumeric characters. This may include data structures like strings, lists,and hash tables that are either built-in or result from combining variables using memorypointers.
Procedures – also known as functions, methods, routines, or subroutines – that take input,generate output, and manipulate data. Modern languages include structured programmingconstructs like loops and conditionals.
Modular programming support provides the ability to group procedures into files and modules fororganizational purposes. Modules are namespaced so identifiers in one module will not conflict with aprocedure or variable sharing the same name in another file or module.
Languages that support object-oriented programming (OOP) typically use inheritance for code reuse andextensibility in the form of either classes or prototypes. Those that use classes support two main concepts:Classes – the definitions for the data format and available procedures for a given type orclass of object; may also contain data and procedures (known as class methods)themselves, i.e. classes contain the data members and member functionsObjects – instances of classesObjects sometimes correspond to things found in the real world. For example, a graphics program may haveobjects such as "circle", "square", "menu". An online shopping system might have objects such as"shopping cart", "customer", and "product".[20] Sometimes objects represent more abstract entities, like anFeaturesShared with non-OOP languagesObjects and classesobject that represents an open file, or an object that provides the service of translating measurements fromU.S. customary to metric.
Each object is said to be an instance of a particular class (for example, an object with its name field set to"Mary" might be an instance of class Employee). Procedures in object-oriented programming are known asmethods; variables are also known as fields, members, attributes, or properties. This leads to the followingterms:Class variables – belong to the class as a whole; there is only one copy of each oneInstance variables or attributes – data that belongs to individual objects; every object has itsown copy of each oneMember variables – refers to both the class and instance variables that are defined by aparticular classClass methods – belong to the class as a whole and have access to only class variables andinputs from the procedure callInstance methods – belong to individual objects, and have access to instance variables forthe specific object they are called on, inputs, and class variablesObjects are accessed somewhat like variables with complex internal structure, and in many languages areeffectively pointers, serving as actual references to a single instance of said object in memory within a heapor stack. They provide a layer of abstraction which can be used to separate internal from external code.
External code can use an object by calling a specific instance method with a certain set of input parameters,read an instance variable, or write to an instance variable. Objects are created by calling a special type ofmethod in the class known as a constructor. A program may create many instances of the same class as itruns, which operate independently. This is an easy way for the same procedures to be used on different setsof data.
Object-oriented programming that uses classes is sometimes called class-based programming, whileprototype-based programming does not typically use classes. As a result, significantly different yetanalogous terminology is used to define the concepts of object and instance.
In some languages classes and objects can be composed using other concepts like traits and mixins.
In class-based languages the classes are defined beforehand and the objects are instantiated based on theclasses. If two objects apple and orange are instantiated from the class Fruit, they are inherently fruits and itis guaranteed that you may handle them in the same way; e.g. a programmer can expect the existence of thesame attributes such as color or sugar_content or is_ripe.
In prototype-based languages the objects are the primary entities. No classes even exist. The prototype of anobject is just another object to which the object is linked. Every object has one prototype link (and onlyone). New objects can be created based on already existing objects chosen as their prototype. You may calltwo different objects apple and orange a fruit, if the object fruit exists, and both apple and orange have fruitas their prototype. The idea of the fruit class doesn't exist explicitly, but as the equivalence class of theobjects sharing the same prototype. The attributes and methods of the prototype are delegated to all theobjects of the equivalence class defined by this prototype. The attributes and methods owned individuallyClass-based vs prototype-basedby the object may not be shared by other objects of the same equivalence class; e.g. the attributesugar_content may be unexpectedly not present in apple. Only single inheritance can be implementedthrough the prototype.
It is the responsibility of the object, not any external code, to select the procedural code to execute inresponse to a method call, typically by looking up the method at run time in a table associated with theobject. This feature is known as dynamic dispatch. If the call variability relies on more than the single typeof the object on which it is called (i.e. at least one other parameter object is involved in the method choice),one speaks of multiple dispatch.
A method call is also known as message passing. It is conceptualized as a message (the name of the methodand its input parameters) being passed to the object for dispatch.
Data Abstraction is a design pattern in which data are visible only to semantically related functions, so as toprevent misuse. The success of data abstraction leads to frequent incorporation of data hiding as a designprinciple in object oriented and pure functional programming.
If a class does not allow calling code to access internal object data and permits access through methodsonly, this is a form of information hiding known as abstraction. Some languages (Java, for example) letclasses enforce access restrictions explicitly, for example denoting internal data with the privatekeyword and designating methods intended for use by code outside the class with the public keyword.
Methods may also be designed public, private, or intermediate levels such as protected (which allowsaccess from the same class and its subclasses, but not objects of a different class). In other languages (likePython) this is enforced only by convention (for example, private methods may have names that startwith an underscore). In C#, Swift & Kotlin languages, internal keyword permits access only to filespresent in same assembly, package or module as that of the class.[21]Encapsulation prevents external code from being concerned with the internal workings of an object. Thisfacilitates code refactoring, for example allowing the author of the class to change how objects of that classrepresent their data internally without changing any external code (as long as "public" method calls workthe same way). It also encourages programmers to put all the code that is concerned with a certain set ofdata in the same class, which organizes it for easy comprehension by other programmers. Encapsulation is atechnique that encourages decoupling.
Objects can contain other objects in their instance variables; this is known as object composition. Forexample, an object in the Employee class might contain (either directly or through a pointer) an object in theAddress class, in addition to its own instance variables like "first_name" and "position". Object compositionis used to represent "has-a" relationships: every employee has an address, so every Employee object hasaccess to a place to store an Address object (either directly embedded within itself, or at a separate locationaddressed via a pointer).
Dynamic dispatch/message passingData AbstractionEncapsulationComposition, inheritance, and delegationLanguages that support classes almost always support inheritance. This allows classes to be arranged in ahierarchy that represents "is-a-type-of" relationships. For example, class Employee might inherit from classPerson. All the data and methods available to the parent class also appear in the child class with the samenames. For example, class Person might define variables "first_name" and "last_name" with method"make_full_name()". These will also be available in class Employee, which might add the variables"position" and "salary". This technique allows easy re-use of the same procedures and data definitions, inaddition to potentially mirroring real-world relationships in an intuitive way. Rather than utilizing databasetables and programming subroutines, the developer utilizes objects the user may be more familiar with:objects from their application domain.[22]Subclasses can override the methods defined by superclasses. Multiple inheritance is allowed in somelanguages, though this can make resolving overrides complicated. Some languages have special support formixins, though in any language with multiple inheritance, a mixin is simply a class that does not representan is-a-type-of relationship. Mixins are typically used to add the same methods to multiple classes. Forexample, class UnicodeConversionMixin might provide a method unicode_to_ascii() when included inclass FileReader and class WebPageScraper, which don't share a common parent.
Abstract classes cannot be instantiated into objects; they exist only for the purpose of inheritance into other"concrete" classes that can be instantiated. In Java, the final keyword can be used to prevent a class frombeing subclassed.
The doctrine of composition over inheritance advocates implementing has-a relationships using compositioninstead of inheritance. For example, instead of inheriting from class Person, class Employee could give eachEmployee object an internal Person object, which it then has the opportunity to hide from external codeeven if class Person has many public attributes or methods. Some languages, like Go do not supportinheritance at all.
The "open/closed principle" advocates that classes and functions "should be open for extension, but closedfor modification".
Delegation is another language feature that can be used as an alternative to inheritance.
Subtyping – a form of polymorphism – is when calling code can be independent of which class in thesupported hierarchy it is operating on – the parent class or one of its descendants. Meanwhile, the sameoperation name among objects in an inheritance hierarchy may behave differently.
For example, objects of type Circle and Square are derived from a common class called Shape. The Drawfunction for each type of Shape implements what is necessary to draw itself while calling code can remainindifferent to the particular type of Shape being drawn.
This is another type of abstraction that simplifies code external to the class hierarchy and enables strongseparation of concerns.
PolymorphismOpen recursionIn languages that support open recursion, object methods can call other methods on the same object(including themselves), typically using a special variable or keyword called this or self. This variableis late-bound; it allows a method defined in one class to invoke another method that is defined later, in somesubclass thereof.
Simula (1967) is generally accepted as being the first language with the primary features of an object-oriented language. It was created for making simulation programs, in which what came to be called objectswere the most important information representation. Smalltalk (1972 to 1980) is another early example, andthe one with which much of the theory of OOP was developed. Concerning the degree of objectorientation, the following distinctions can be made:Languages called "pure" OO languages, because everything in them is treated consistentlyas an object, from primitives such as characters and punctuation, all the way up to wholeclasses, prototypes, blocks, modules, etc. They were designed specifically to facilitate, evenenforce, OO methods. Examples: Ruby, Scala, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Emerald,[23] JADE, Self,Raku.
Languages designed mainly for OO programming, but with some procedural elements.
Examples: Java, Python, C++, C#, Delphi/Object Pascal, VB.NET.
Languages that are historically procedural languages, but have been extended with someOO features. Examples: PHP, Perl, Visual Basic (derived from BASIC), MATLAB, COBOL2002, Fortran 2003, ABAP, Ada 95, Pascal.
Languages with most of the features of objects (classes, methods, inheritance), but in adistinctly original form. Examples: Oberon (Oberon-1 or Oberon-2).
Languages with abstract data type support which may be used to resemble OOprogramming, but without all features of object-orientation. This includes object-based andprototype-based languages. Examples: JavaScript, Lua, Modula-2, CLU.
Chameleon languages that support multiple paradigms, including OO. Tcl stands out amongthese for TclOO, a hybrid object system that supports both prototype-based programming andclass-based OO.
In recent years, object-oriented programming has become especially popular in dynamic programminglanguages. Python, PowerShell, Ruby and Groovy are dynamic languages built on OOP principles, whilePerl and PHP have been adding object-oriented features since Perl 5 and PHP 4, and ColdFusion sinceversion 6.
The Document Object Model of HTML, XHTML, and XML documents on the Internet has bindings to thepopular JavaScript/ECMAScript language. JavaScript is perhaps the best known prototype-basedprogramming language, which employs cloning from prototypes rather than inheriting from a class (contrastto class-based programming). Another scripting language that takes this approach is Lua.
The messages that flow between computers to request services in a client-server environment can bedesigned as the linearizations of objects defined by class objects known to both the client and the server. Forexample, a simple linearized object would consist of a length field, a code point identifying the class, and adata value. A more complex example would be a command consisting of the length and code point of theOOP languagesOOP in dynamic languagesOOP in a network protocolcommand and values consisting of linearized objects representing the command's parameters. Each suchcommand must be directed by the server to an object whose class (or superclass) recognizes the commandand is able to provide the requested service. Clients and servers are best modeled as complex object-oriented structures. Distributed Data Management Architecture (DDM) took this approach and used classobjects to define objects at four levels of a formal hierarchy:Fields defining the data values that form messages, such as their length, code point and datavalues.
Objects and collections of objects similar to what would be found in a Smalltalk program formessages and parameters.
Managers similar to IBM i Objects, such as a directory to files and files consisting ofmetadata and records. Managers conceptually provide memory and processing resourcesfor their contained objects.
A client or server consisting of all the managers necessary to implement a full processingenvironment, supporting such aspects as directory services, security and concurrencycontrol.
The initial version of DDM defined distributed file services. It was later extended to be the foundation ofDistributed Relational Database Architecture (DRDA).
Challenges of object-oriented design are addressed by several approaches. Most common is known as thedesign patterns codified by Gamma et al.. More broadly, the term "design patterns" can be used to refer toany general, repeatable, solution pattern to a commonly occurring problem in software design. Some ofthese commonly occurring problems have implications and solutions particular to object-orienteddevelopment.
It is intuitive to assume that inheritance creates a semantic "is a" relationship, and thus to infer that objectsinstantiated from subclasses can always be safely used instead of those instantiated from the superclass. Thisintuition is unfortunately false in most OOP languages, in particular in all those that allow mutable objects.
Subtype polymorphism as enforced by the type checker in OOP languages (with mutable objects) cannotguarantee behavioral subtyping in any context. Behavioral subtyping is undecidable in general, so it cannotbe implemented by a program (compiler). Class or object hierarchies must be carefully designed,considering possible incorrect uses that cannot be detected syntactically. This issue is known as the Liskovsubstitution principle.
Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software is an influential book published in 1994by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides, often referred to humorously as the"Gang of Four". Along with exploring the capabilities and pitfalls of object-oriented programming, itdescribes 23 common programming problems and patterns for solving them. As of April 2007, the bookwas in its 36th printing.
The book describes the following patterns:Design patternsInheritance and behavioral subtypingGang of Four design patternsCreational patterns (5): Factory method pattern, Abstract factory pattern, Singleton pattern,Builder pattern, Prototype patternStructural patterns (7): Adapter pattern, Bridge pattern, Composite pattern, Decorator pattern,Facade pattern, Flyweight pattern, Proxy patternBehavioral patterns (11): Chain-of-responsibility pattern, Command pattern, Interpreterpattern, Iterator pattern, Mediator pattern, Memento pattern, Observer pattern, State pattern,Strategy pattern, Template method pattern, Visitor patternBoth object-oriented programming and relational database management systems (RDBMSs) are extremelycommon in software today. Since relational databases don't store objects directly (though some RDBMSshave object-oriented features to approximate this), there is a general need to bridge the two worlds. Theproblem of bridging object-oriented programming accesses and data patterns with relational databases isknown as object-relational impedance mismatch. There are a number of approaches to cope with thisproblem, but no general solution without downsides.[24] One of the most common approaches is object-relational mapping, as found in IDE languages such as Visual FoxPro and libraries such as Java DataObjects and Ruby on Rails' ActiveRecord.
There are also object databases that can be used to replace RDBMSs, but these have not been as technicallyand commercially successful as RDBMSs.
OOP can be used to associate real-world objects and processes with digital counterparts. However, noteveryone agrees that OOP facilitates direct real-world mapping (see Criticism section) or that real-worldmapping is even a worthy goal; Bertrand Meyer argues in Object-Oriented Software Construction[25] that aprogram is not a model of the world but a model of some part of the world; "Reality is a cousin twiceremoved". At the same time, some principal limitations of OOP have been noted.[26] For example, thecircle-ellipse problem is difficult to handle using OOP's concept of inheritance.
However, Niklaus Wirth (who popularized the adage now known as Wirth's law: "Software is gettingslower more rapidly than hardware becomes faster") said of OOP in his paper, "Good Ideas through theLooking Glass", "This paradigm closely reflects the structure of systems 'in the real world', and it istherefore well suited to model complex systems with complex behaviours"[27] (contrast KISS principle).
Steve Yegge and others noted that natural languages lack the OOP approach of strictly prioritizing things(objects/nouns) before actions (methods/verbs).[28] This problem may cause OOP to suffer moreconvoluted solutions than procedural programming.[29]Object-orientation and databasesReal-world modeling and relationshipsOOP and control flowOOP was developed to increase the reusability and maintainability of source code.[30] Transparentrepresentation of the control flow had no priority and was meant to be handled by a compiler. With theincreasing relevance of parallel hardware and multithreaded coding, developing transparent control flowbecomes more important, something hard to achieve with OOP.[31][32][33][34]Responsibility-driven design defines classes in terms of a contract, that is, a class should be defined arounda responsibility and the information that it shares. This is contrasted by Wirfs-Brock and Wilkerson withdata-driven design, where classes are defined around the data-structures that must be held. The authors holdthat responsibility-driven design is preferable.
SOLID is a mnemonic invented by Michael Feathers which spells out five software engineering designprinciples:Single responsibility principleOpen/closed principleLiskov substitution principleInterface segregation principleDependency inversion principleGRASP (General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns) is another set of guidelines advocated byCraig Larman.
The OOP paradigm has been criticised for a number of reasons, including not meeting its stated goals ofreusability and modularity,[35][36] and for overemphasizing one aspect of software design and modeling(data/objects) at the expense of other important aspects (computation/algorithms).[37][38]Luca Cardelli has claimed that OOP code is "intrinsically less efficient" than procedural code, that OOP cantake longer to compile, and that OOP languages have "extremely poor modularity properties with respect toclass extension and modification", and tend to be extremely complex.[35] The latter point is reiterated by JoeArmstrong, the principal inventor of Erlang, who is quoted as saying:[36]The problem with object-oriented languages is they've got all this implicit environment thatthey carry around with them. You wanted a banana but what you got was a gorilla holding thebanana and the entire jungle.
A study by Potok et al. has shown no significant difference in productivity between OOP and proceduralapproaches.[39]Christopher J. Date stated that critical comparison of OOP to other technologies, relational in particular, isdifficult because of lack of an agreed-upon and rigorous definition of OOP;[40] however, Date and Darwenhave proposed a theoretical foundation on OOP that uses OOP as a kind of customizable type system tosupport RDBMS.[41]Responsibility- vs. data-driven designSOLID and GRASP guidelinesCriticismIn an article Lawrence Krubner claimed that compared to other languages (LISP dialects, functionallanguages, etc.) OOP languages have no unique strengths, and inflict a heavy burden of unneededcomplexity.[42]Alexander Stepanov compares object orientation unfavourably to generic programming:[37]I find OOP technically unsound. It attempts to decompose the world in terms of interfaces thatvary on a single type. To deal with the real problems you need multisorted algebras — familiesof interfaces that span multiple types. I find OOP philosophically unsound. It claims thateverything is an object. Even if it is true it is not very interesting — saying that everything is anobject is saying nothing at all.
Paul Graham has suggested that OOP's popularity within large companies is due to "large (and frequentlychanging) groups of mediocre programmers". According to Graham, the discipline imposed by OOPprevents any one programmer from "doing too much damage".[43]Leo Brodie has suggested a connection between the standalone nature of objects and a tendency toduplicate code[44] in violation of the don't repeat yourself principle[45] of software development.
Steve Yegge noted that, as opposed to functional programming:[46]Object Oriented Programming puts the Nouns first and foremost. Why would you go to suchlengths to put one part of speech on a pedestal? Why should one kind of concept takeprecedence over another? It's not as if OOP has suddenly made verbs less important in the waywe actually think. It's a strangely skewed perspective.
Rich Hickey, creator of Clojure, described object systems as overly simplistic models of the real world. Heemphasized the inability of OOP to model time properly, which is getting increasingly problematic assoftware systems become more concurrent.[38]Eric S. Raymond, a Unix programmer and open-source software advocate, has been critical of claims thatpresent object-oriented programming as the "One True Solution", and has written that object-orientedprogramming languages tend to encourage thickly layered programs that destroy transparency.[47]Raymond compares this unfavourably to the approach taken with Unix and the C programminglanguage.[47]Rob Pike, a programmer involved in the creation of UTF-8 and Go, has called object-orientedprogramming "the Roman numerals of computing"[48] and has said that OOP languages frequently shift thefocus from data structures and algorithms to types.[49] Furthermore, he cites an instance of a Java professorwhose "idiomatic" solution to a problem was to create six new classes, rather than to simply use a lookuptable.[50]Regarding inheritance, Bob Martin states that because they are software, related classes do not necessarilyshare the relationships of the things they represent.[51]Objects are the run-time entities in an object-oriented system. They may represent a person, a place, a bankaccount, a table of data, or any item that the program has to handle.
Formal semanticsThere have been several attempts at formalizing the concepts used in object-oriented programming. Thefollowing concepts and constructs have been used as interpretations of OOP concepts:co algebraic data types[52]recursive typesencapsulated stateinheritancerecords are basis for understanding objects if function literals can be stored in fields (like infunctional-programming languages), but the actual calculi need be considerably morecomplex to incorporate essential features of OOP. Several extensions of System F<: that dealwith mutable objects have been studied;[53] these allow both subtype polymorphism andparametric polymorphism (generics)Attempts to find a consensus definition or theory behind objects have not proven very successful (however,see Abadi & Cardelli, A Theory of Objects (http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=547964&dl=ACM&coll=portal)[53] for formal definitions of many OOP concepts and constructs), and often diverge widely. Forexample, some definitions focus on mental activities, and some on program structuring. One of the simplerdefinitions is that OOP is the act of using "map" data structures or arrays that can contain functions andpointers to other maps, all with some syntactic and scoping sugar on top. Inheritance can be performed bycloning the maps (sometimes called "prototyping").
