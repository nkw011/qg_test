Representing images on multiple layers ofabstraction in deep learning[1]Deep learningDeep learning (also known as deep structuredlearning) is part of a broader family of machinelearning methods based on artificial neural networkswith representation learning. Learning can besupervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.[2]Deep-learning architectures such as deep neuralnetworks, deep belief networks, deep reinforcementlearning, recurrent neural networks, convolutionalneural networks and Transformers have been appliedto fields including computer vision, speech recognition,natural language processing, machine translation,bioinformatics, drug design, medical image analysis,climate science, material inspection and board gameprograms, where they have produced resultscomparable to and in some cases surpassing humanexpert performance.[3][4][5]Artificial neural networks (ANNs) were inspired by information processing and distributed communicationnodes in biological systems. ANNs have various differences from biological brains. Specifically, artificialneural networks tend to be static and symbolic, while the biological brain of most living organisms isdynamic (plastic) and analog.[6][7]The adjective "deep" in deep learning refers to the use of multiple layers in the network. Early workshowed that a linear perceptron cannot be a universal classifier, but that a network with a nonpolynomialactivation function with one hidden layer of unbounded width can. Deep learning is a modern variationwhich is concerned with an unbounded number of layers of bounded size, which permits practicalapplication and optimized implementation, while retaining theoretical universality under mild conditions. Indeep learning the layers are also permitted to be heterogeneous and to deviate widely from biologicallyinformed connectionist models, for the sake of efficiency, trainability and understandability, hence the"structured" part.
Deep learning is a class of machine learning algorithms that[8]: 199–200  uses multiple layers to progressivelyextract higher-level features from the raw input. For example, in image processing, lower layers mayidentify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits or letters orfaces.
Most modern deep learning models are based on artificial neural networks, specifically convolutional neuralnetworks (CNN)s, although they can also include propositional formulas or latent variables organized layer-wise in deep generative models such as the nodes in deep belief networks and deep Boltzmann machines.[9]DefinitionOverviewIn deep learning, each level learns to transform its input data into a slightly more abstract and compositerepresentation. In an image recognition application, the raw input may be a matrix of pixels; the firstrepresentational layer may abstract the pixels and encode edges; the second layer may compose and encodearrangements of edges; the third layer may encode a nose and eyes; and the fourth layer may recognize thatthe image contains a face. Importantly, a deep learning process can learn which features to optimally placein which level on its own. This does not eliminate the need for hand-tuning; for example, varying numbersof layers and layer sizes can provide different degrees of abstraction.[10][11]The word "deep" in "deep learning" refers to the number of layers through which the data is transformed.
More precisely, deep learning systems have a substantial credit assignment path (CAP) depth. The CAP isthe chain of transformations from input to output. CAPs describe potentially causal connections betweeninput and output. For a feedforward neural network, the depth of the CAPs is that of the network and is thenumber of hidden layers plus one (as the output layer is also parameterized). For recurrent neural networks,in which a signal may propagate through a layer more than once, the CAP depth is potentially unlimited.[12]No universally agreed-upon threshold of depth divides shallow learning from deep learning, but mostresearchers agree that deep learning involves CAP depth higher than 2. CAP of depth 2 has been shown tobe a universal approximator in the sense that it can emulate any function.[13] Beyond that, more layers donot add to the function approximator ability of the network. Deep models (CAP > 2) are able to extractbetter features than shallow models and hence, extra layers help in learning the features effectively.
Deep learning architectures can be constructed with a greedy layer-by-layer method.[14] Deep learninghelps to disentangle these abstractions and pick out which features improve performance.[10]For supervised learning tasks, deep learning methods eliminate feature engineering, by translating the datainto compact intermediate representations akin to principal components, and derive layered structures thatremove redundancy in representation.
Deep learning algorithms can be applied to unsupervised learning tasks. This is an important benefitbecause unlabeled data are more abundant than the labeled data. Examples of deep structures that can betrained in an unsupervised manner are deep belief networks.[10][15]Deep neural networks are generally interpreted in terms of the universal approximationtheorem[16][17][18][19][20] or probabilistic inference.[21][8][10][12][22]The classic universal approximation theorem concerns the capacity of feedforward neural networks with asingle hidden layer of finite size to approximate continuous functions.[16][17][18][19] In 1989, the first proofwas published by George Cybenko for sigmoid activation functions[16] and was generalised to feed-forward multi-layer architectures in 1991 by Kurt Hornik.[17] Recent work also showed that universalapproximation also holds for non-bounded activation functions such as the rectified linear unit.[23]The universal approximation theorem for deep neural networks concerns the capacity of networks withbounded width but the depth is allowed to grow. Lu et al.[20] proved that if the width of a deep neuralnetwork with ReLU activation is strictly larger than the input dimension, then the network can approximateany Lebesgue integrable function; If the width is smaller or equal to the input dimension, then a deep neuralnetwork is not a universal approximator.
The probabilistic interpretation[22] derives from the field of machine learning. It featuresinference,[8][9][10][12][15][22] as well as the optimization concepts of training and testing, related to fittingand generalization, respectively. More specifically, the probabilistic interpretation considers the activationInterpretationsnonlinearity as a cumulative distribution function.[22] The probabilistic interpretation led to the introductionof dropout as regularizer in neural networks. The probabilistic interpretation was introduced by researchersincluding Hopfield, Widrow and Narendra and popularized in surveys such as the one by Bishop.[24]Some sources point out that Frank Rosenblatt developed and explored all of the basic ingredients of thedeep learning systems of today.[25] He described it in his book "Principles of Neurodynamics: Perceptronsand the Theory of Brain Mechanisms", published by Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory, Inc., CornellUniversity in 1962.
The first general, working learning algorithm for supervised, deep, feedforward, multilayer perceptrons waspublished by Alexey Ivakhnenko and Lapa in 1967.[26] A 1971 paper described a deep network with eightlayers trained by the group method of data handling.[27] Other deep learning working architectures,specifically those built for computer vision, began with the Neocognitron introduced by KunihikoFukushima in 1980.[28]The term Deep Learning was introduced to the machine learning community by Rina Dechter in 1986,[29]and to artificial neural networks by Igor Aizenberg and colleagues in 2000, in the context of Booleanthreshold neurons.[30][31]In 1989, Yann LeCun et al. applied the standard backpropagation algorithm, which had been around as thereverse mode of automatic differentiation since 1970,[32][33][34][35] to a deep neural network with thepurpose of recognizing handwritten ZIP codes on mail. While the algorithm worked, training required 3days.[36]Independently in 1988, Wei Zhang et al. applied the backpropagation algorithm to a convolutional neuralnetwork (a simplified Neocognitron by keeping only the convolutional interconnections between the imagefeature layers and the last fully connected layer) for alphabets recognition and also proposed animplementation of the CNN with an optical computing system.[37][38] Subsequently, Wei Zhang, et al.
modified the model by removing the last fully connected layer and applied it for medical image objectsegmentation in 1991[39] and breast cancer detection in mammograms in 1994.[40]In 1994, André de Carvalho, together with Mike Fairhurst and David Bisset, published experimental resultsof a multi-layer boolean neural network, also known as a weightless neural network, composed of a 3-layers self-organising feature extraction neural network module (SOFT) followed by a multi-layerclassification neural network module (GSN), which were independently trained. Each layer in the featureextraction module extracted features with growing complexity regarding the previous layer.[41]In 1995, Brendan Frey demonstrated that it was possible to train (over two days) a network containing sixfully connected layers and several hundred hidden units using the wake-sleep algorithm, co-developed withPeter Dayan and Hinton.[42] Many factors contribute to the slow speed, including the vanishing gradientproblem analyzed in 1991 by Sepp Hochreiter.[43][44]Since 1997, Sven Behnke extended the feed-forward hierarchical convolutional approach in the NeuralAbstraction Pyramid[45] by lateral and backward connections in order to flexibly incorporate context intodecisions and iteratively resolve local ambiguities.
Simpler models that use task-specific handcrafted features such as Gabor filters and support vectormachines (SVMs) were a popular choice in the 1990s and 2000s, because of artificial neural network's(ANN) computational cost and a lack of understanding of how the brain wires its biological networks.
HistoryBoth shallow and deep learning (e.g., recurrent nets) of ANNs have been explored for manyyears.[46][47][48] These methods never outperformed non-uniform internal-handcrafting Gaussian mixturemodel/Hidden Markov model (GMM-HMM) technology based on generative models of speech traineddiscriminatively.[49] Key difficulties have been analyzed, including gradient diminishing[43] and weaktemporal correlation structure in neural predictive models.[50][51] Additional difficulties were the lack oftraining data and limited computing power.
Most speech recognition researchers moved away from neural nets to pursue generative modeling. Anexception was at SRI International in the late 1990s. Funded by the US government's NSA and DARPA,SRI studied deep neural networks in speech and speaker recognition. The speaker recognition team led byLarry Heck reported significant success with deep neural networks in speech processing in the 1998National Institute of Standards and Technology Speaker Recognition evaluation.[52] The SRI deep neuralnetwork was then deployed in the Nuance Verifier, representing the first major industrial application of deeplearning.[53]The principle of elevating "raw" features over hand-crafted optimization was first explored successfully inthe architecture of deep autoencoder on the "raw" spectrogram or linear filter-bank features in the late1990s,[53] showing its superiority over the Mel-Cepstral features that contain stages of fixed transformationfrom spectrograms. The raw features of speech, waveforms, later produced excellent larger-scale results.[54]Many aspects of speech recognition were taken over by a deep learning method called long short-termmemory (LSTM), a recurrent neural network published by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber in 1997.[55] LSTMRNNs avoid the vanishing gradient problem and can learn "Very Deep Learning" tasks[12] that requirememories of events that happened thousands of discrete time steps before, which is important for speech. In2003, LSTM started to become competitive with traditional speech recognizers on certain tasks.[56] Later itwas combined with connectionist temporal classification (CTC)[57] in stacks of LSTM RNNs.[58] In 2015,Google's speech recognition reportedly experienced a dramatic performance jump of 49% through CTC-trained LSTM, which they made available through Google Voice Search.[59]In 2006, publications by Geoff Hinton, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Osindero and Teh[60][61][62] showed how amany-layered feedforward neural network could be effectively pre-trained one layer at a time, treating eachlayer in turn as an unsupervised restricted Boltzmann machine, then fine-tuning it using supervisedbackpropagation.[63] The papers referred to learning for deep belief nets.
Deep learning is part of state-of-the-art systems in various disciplines, particularly computer vision andautomatic speech recognition (ASR). Results on commonly used evaluation sets such as TIMIT (ASR) andMNIST (image classification), as well as a range of large-vocabulary speech recognition tasks have steadilyimproved.[64][65] Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were superseded for ASR by CTC[57] forLSTM.[55][59][66][67][68] but are more successful in computer vision.
The impact of deep learning in industry began in the early 2000s, when CNNs already processed anestimated 10% to 20% of all the checks written in the US, according to Yann LeCun.[69] Industrialapplications of deep learning to large-scale speech recognition started around 2010.
The 2009 NIPS Workshop on Deep Learning for Speech Recognition was motivated by the limitations ofdeep generative models of speech, and the possibility that given more capable hardware and large-scale datasets that deep neural nets (DNN) might become practical. It was believed that pre-training DNNs usinggenerative models of deep belief nets (DBN) would overcome the main difficulties of neural nets. However,it was discovered that replacing pre-training with large amounts of training data for straightforwardbackpropagation when using DNNs with large, context-dependent output layers produced error ratesdramatically lower than then-state-of-the-art Gaussian mixture model (GMM)/Hidden Markov Model(HMM) and also than more-advanced generative model-based systems.[64] The nature of the recognitionHow deep learning is a subset ofmachine learning and how machinelearning is a subset of artificialintelligence (AI)errors produced by the two types of systems was characteristically different,[70] offering technical insightsinto how to integrate deep learning into the existing highly efficient, run-time speech decoding systemdeployed by all major speech recognition systems.[8][71][72] Analysis around 2009–2010, contrasting theGMM (and other generative speech models) vs. DNN models, stimulated early industrial investment indeep learning for speech recognition,[70] eventually leading to pervasive and dominant use in that industry.
That analysis was done with comparable performance (less than 1.5% in error rate) between discriminativeDNNs and generative models.[64][70][73]In 2010, researchers extended deep learning from TIMIT to large vocabulary speech recognition, byadopting large output layers of the DNN based on context-dependent HMM states constructed by decisiontrees.[74][75][76][71]Advances in hardware have driven renewed interest in deep learning. In 2009, Nvidia was involved in whatwas called the “big bang” of deep learning, “as deep-learning neural networks were trained with Nvidiagraphics processing units (GPUs).”[77] That year, Andrew Ng determined that GPUs could increase thespeed of deep-learning systems by about 100 times.[78] In particular, GPUs are well-suited for thematrix/vector computations involved in machine learning.[79][80][81] GPUs speed up training algorithms byorders of magnitude, reducing running times from weeks to days.[82][83] Further, specialized hardware andalgorithm optimizations can be used for efficient processing of deep learning models.[84]In 2012, a team led by George E. Dahl won the "Merck MolecularActivity Challenge" using multi-task deep neural networks topredict the biomolecular target of one drug.[85][86] In 2014,Hochreiter's group used deep learning to detect off-target and toxiceffects of environmental chemicals in nutrients, household productsand drugs and won the "Tox21 Data Challenge" of NIH, FDA andNCATS.[87][88][89]Significant additional impacts in image or object recognition werefelt from 2011 to 2012. Although CNNs trained bybackpropagation had been around for decades, and GPUimplementations of NNs for years, including CNNs, fastimplementations of CNNs on GPUs were needed to progress oncomputer vision.[79][81][36][90][12] In 2011, this approach achievedfor the first time superhuman performance in a visual patternrecognition contest. Also in 2011, it won the ICDAR Chinesehandwriting contest, and in May 2012, it won the ISBI imagesegmentation contest.[91] Until 2011, CNNs did not play a majorrole at computer vision conferences, but in June 2012, a paper by Ciresan et al. at the leading conferenceCVPR[3] showed how max-pooling CNNs on GPU can dramatically improve many vision benchmarkrecords. In October 2012, a similar system by Krizhevsky et al.[4] won the large-scale ImageNetcompetition by a significant margin over shallow machine learning methods. In November 2012, Ciresan etal.'s system also won the ICPR contest on analysis of large medical images for cancer detection, and in thefollowing year also the MICCAI Grand Challenge on the same topic.[92] In 2013 and 2014, the error rateon the ImageNet task using deep learning was further reduced, following a similar trend in large-scalespeech recognition.
Image classification was then extended to the more challenging task of generating descriptions (captions)for images, often as a combination of CNNs and LSTMs.[93][94][95]Deep learning revolutionSome researchers state that the October 2012 ImageNet victory anchored the start of a "deep learningrevolution" that has transformed the AI industry.[96]In March 2019, Yoshua Bengio, Geoffrey Hinton and Yann LeCun were awarded the Turing Award forconceptual and engineering breakthroughs that have made deep neural networks a critical component ofcomputing.
Artificial neural networks (ANNs) or connectionist systems are computing systems inspired by thebiological neural networks that constitute animal brains. Such systems learn (progressively improve theirability) to do tasks by considering examples, generally without task-specific programming. For example, inimage recognition, they might learn to identify images that contain cats by analyzing example images thathave been manually labeled as "cat" or "no cat" and using the analytic results to identify cats in otherimages. They have found most use in applications difficult to express with a traditional computer algorithmusing rule-based programming.
An ANN is based on a collection of connected units called artificial neurons, (analogous to biologicalneurons in a biological brain). Each connection (synapse) between neurons can transmit a signal to anotherneuron. The receiving (postsynaptic) neuron can process the signal(s) and then signal downstream neuronsconnected to it. Neurons may have state, generally represented by real numbers, typically between 0 and 1.
Neurons and synapses may also have a weight that varies as learning proceeds, which can increase ordecrease the strength of the signal that it sends downstream.
Typically, neurons are organized in layers. Different layers may perform different kinds of transformationson their inputs. Signals travel from the first (input), to the last (output) layer, possibly after traversing thelayers multiple times.
The original goal of the neural network approach was to solve problems in the same way that a humanbrain would. Over time, attention focused on matching specific mental abilities, leading to deviations frombiology such as backpropagation, or passing information in the reverse direction and adjusting the networkto reflect that information.
Neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks, including computer vision, speech recognition,machine translation, social network filtering, playing board and video games and medical diagnosis.
As of 2017, neural networks typically have a few thousand to a few million units and millions ofconnections. Despite this number being several order of magnitude less than the number of neurons on ahuman brain, these networks can perform many tasks at a level beyond that of humans (e.g., recognizingfaces, or playing "Go"[97] ).
A deep neural network (DNN) is an artificial neural network (ANN) with multiple layers between the inputand output layers.[9][12] There are different types of neural networks but they always consist of the samecomponents: neurons, synapses, weights, biases, and functions.[98] These components as a whole functionsimilarly to a human brain, and can be trained like any other ML algorithm.
Neural networksArtificial neural networksDeep neural networksFor example, a DNN that is trained to recognize dog breeds will go over the given image and calculate theprobability that the dog in the image is a certain breed. The user can review the results and select whichprobabilities the network should display (above a certain threshold, etc.) and return the proposed label. Eachmathematical manipulation as such is considered a layer, and complex DNN have many layers, hence thename "deep" networks.
DNNs can model complex non-linear relationships. DNN architectures generate compositional modelswhere the object is expressed as a layered composition of primitives.[99] The extra layers enablecomposition of features from lower layers, potentially modeling complex data with fewer units than asimilarly performing shallow network.[9] For instance, it was proved that sparse multivariate polynomialsare exponentially easier to approximate with DNNs than with shallow networks.[100]Deep architectures include many variants of a few basic approaches. Each architecture has found success inspecific domains. It is not always possible to compare the performance of multiple architectures, unless theyhave been evaluated on the same data sets.
DNNs are typically feedforward networks in which data flows from the input layer to the output layerwithout looping back. At first, the DNN creates a map of virtual neurons and assigns random numericalvalues, or "weights", to connections between them. The weights and inputs are multiplied and return anoutput between 0 and 1. If the network did not accurately recognize a particular pattern, an algorithm wouldadjust the weights.[101] That way the algorithm can make certain parameters more influential, until itdetermines the correct mathematical manipulation to fully process the data.
Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), in which data can flow in any direction, are used for applications suchas language modeling.[102][103][104][105][106] Long short-term memory is particularly effective for thisuse.[55][107]Convolutional deep neural networks (CNNs) are used in computer vision.[108] CNNs also have beenapplied to acoustic modeling for automatic speech recognition (ASR).[109]As with ANNs, many issues can arise with naively trained DNNs. Two common issues are overfitting andcomputation time.
DNNs are prone to overfitting because of the added layers of abstraction, which allow them to model raredependencies in the training data. Regularization methods such as Ivakhnenko's unit pruning[27] or weightdecay (-regularization) or sparsity (-regularization) can be applied during training to combatoverfitting.[110] Alternatively dropout regularization randomly omits units from the hidden layers duringtraining. This helps to exclude rare dependencies.[111] Finally, data can be augmented via methods such ascropping and rotating such that smaller training sets can be increased in size to reduce the chances ofoverfitting.[112]DNNs must consider many training parameters, such as the size (number of layers and number of units perlayer), the learning rate, and initial weights. Sweeping through the parameter space for optimal parametersmay not be feasible due to the cost in time and computational resources. Various tricks, such as batching(computing the gradient on several training examples at once rather than individual examples)[113] speed upcomputation. Large processing capabilities of many-core architectures (such as GPUs or the Intel Xeon Phi)have produced significant speedups in training, because of the suitability of such processing architecturesfor the matrix and vector computations.[114][115]ChallengesAlternatively, engineers may look for other types of neural networks with more straightforward andconvergent training algorithms. CMAC (cerebellar model articulation controller) is one such kind of neuralnetwork. It doesn't require learning rates or randomized initial weights for CMAC. The training process canbe guaranteed to converge in one step with a new batch of data, and the computational complexity of thetraining algorithm is linear with respect to the number of neurons involved.[116][117]Since the 2010s, advances in both machine learning algorithms and computer hardware have led to moreefficient methods for training deep neural networks that contain many layers of non-linear hidden units anda very large output layer.[118] By 2019, graphic processing units (GPUs), often with AI-specificenhancements, had displaced CPUs as the dominant method of training large-scale commercial cloudAI.[119] OpenAI estimated the hardware computation used in the largest deep learning projects fromAlexNet (2012) to AlphaZero (2017), and found a 300,000-fold increase in the amount of computationrequired, with a doubling-time trendline of 3.4 months.[120][121]Special electronic circuits called deep learning processors were designed to speed up deep learningalgorithms. Deep learning processors include neural processing units (NPUs) in Huawei cellphones[122]and cloud computing servers such as tensor processing units (TPU) in the Google Cloud Platform.[123]Cerebras Systems has also built a dedicated system to handle large deep learning models, the CS-2, basedon the largest processor in the industry, the second-generation Wafer Scale Engine (WSE-2).[124][125]Atomically thin semiconductors are considered promising for energy-efficient deep learning hardwarewhere the same basic device structure is used for both logic operations and data storage. In 2020, Marega etal. published experiments with a large-area active channel material for developing logic-in-memory devicesand circuits based on floating-gate field-effect transistors (FGFETs).[126]In 2021, J. Feldmann et al. proposed an integrated photonic hardware accelerator for parallel convolutionalprocessing.[127] The authors identify two key advantages of integrated photonics over its electroniccounterparts: (1) massively parallel data transfer through wavelength division multiplexing in conjunctionwith frequency combs, and (2) extremely high data modulation speeds.[127] Their system can executetrillions of multiply-accumulate operations per second, indicating the potential of integrated photonics indata-heavy AI applications.[127]Large-scale automatic speech recognition is the first and most convincing successful case of deep learning.
LSTM RNNs can learn "Very Deep Learning" tasks[12] that involve multi-second intervals containingspeech events separated by thousands of discrete time steps, where one time step corresponds to about 10ms. LSTM with forget gates[107] is competitive with traditional speech recognizers on certain tasks.[56]The initial success in speech recognition was based on small-scale recognition tasks based on TIMIT. Thedata set contains 630 speakers from eight major dialects of American English, where each speaker reads 10sentences.[128] Its small size lets many configurations be tried. More importantly, the TIMIT task concernsphone-sequence recognition, which, unlike word-sequence recognition, allows weak phone bigramHardwareApplicationsAutomatic speech recognitionlanguage models. This lets the strength of the acoustic modeling aspects of speech recognition be moreeasily analyzed. The error rates listed below, including these early results and measured as percent phoneerror rates (PER), have been summarized since 1991.

All major commercial speech recognition systems (e.g., Microsoft Cortana, Xbox, Skype Translator,Amazon Alexa, Google Now, Apple Siri, Baidu and iFlyTek voice search, and a range of Nuance speechproducts, etc.) are based on deep learning.[8][133][134]A common evaluation set for image classification is the MNIST database data set. MNIST is composed ofhandwritten digits and includes 60,000 training examples and 10,000 test examples. As with TIMIT, itssmall size lets users test multiple configurations. A comprehensive list of results on this set is available.[135]Deep learning-based image recognition has become "superhuman", producing more accurate results thanhuman contestants. This first occurred in 2011 in recognition of traffic signs, and in 2014, with recognitionof human faces.[136][137]Image recognitionDeep learning-trained vehicles now interpret 360° camera views.[138] Another example is FacialDysmorphology Novel Analysis (FDNA) used to analyze cases of human malformation connected to alarge database of genetic syndromes.
Closely related to the progress that has been made in image recognition is the increasing application of deeplearning techniques to various visual art tasks. DNNs have proven themselves capable, for example, ofidentifying the style period of a given painting[139][140]Neural Style Transfer – capturing the style of a given artwork and applying it in a visuallypleasing manner to an arbitrary photograph or video[139][140]generating striking imagery based on random visual input fields.[139][140]Neural networks have been used for implementing language models since the early 2000s.[102] LSTMhelped to improve machine translation and language modeling.[103][104][105]Other key techniques in this field are negative sampling[141] and word embedding. Word embedding, suchas word2vec, can be thought of as a representational layer in a deep learning architecture that transforms anatomic word into a positional representation of the word relative to other words in the dataset; the position isrepresented as a point in a vector space. Using word embedding as an RNN input layer allows the networkto parse sentences and phrases using an effective compositional vector grammar. A compositional vectorgrammar can be thought of as probabilistic context free grammar (PCFG) implemented by an RNN.[142]Recursive auto-encoders built atop word embeddings can assess sentence similarity and detectparaphrasing.[142] Deep neural architectures provide the best results for constituency parsing,[143] sentimentanalysis,[144] information retrieval,[145][146] spoken language understanding,[147] machinetranslation,[103][148] contextual entity linking,[148] writing style recognition,[149] Text classification andothers.[150]Recent developments generalize word embedding to sentence embedding.
Google Translate (GT) uses a large end-to-end long short-term memory (LSTM)network.[151][152][153][154] Google Neural Machine Translation (GNMT) uses an example-based machinetranslation method in which the system "learns from millions of examples."[152] It translates "wholesentences at a time, rather than pieces. Google Translate supports over one hundred languages.[152] Thenetwork encodes the "semantics of the sentence rather than simply memorizing phrase-to-phrasetranslations".[152][155] GT uses English as an intermediate between most language pairs.[155]A large percentage of candidate drugs fail to win regulatory approval. These failures are caused byinsufficient efficacy (on-target effect), undesired interactions (off-target effects), or unanticipated toxiceffects.[156][157] Research has explored use of deep learning to predict the biomolecular targets,[85][86] off-targets, and toxic effects of environmental chemicals in nutrients, household products and drugs.[87][88][89]Visual art processingNatural language processingDrug discovery and toxicologyAtomNet is a deep learning system for structure-based rational drug design.[158] AtomNet was used topredict novel candidate biomolecules for disease targets such as the Ebola virus[159] and multiplesclerosis.[160][161]In 2017 graph neural networks were used for the first time to predict various properties of molecules in alarge toxicology data set.[162] In 2019, generative neural networks were used to produce molecules thatwere validated experimentally all the way into mice.[163][164]Deep reinforcement learning has been used to approximate the value of possible direct marketing actions,defined in terms of RFM variables. The estimated value function was shown to have a natural interpretationas customer lifetime value.[165]Recommendation systems have used deep learning to extract meaningful features for a latent factor modelfor content-based music and journal recommendations.[166][167] Multi-view deep learning has been appliedfor learning user preferences from multiple domains.[168] The model uses a hybrid collaborative andcontent-based approach and enhances recommendations in multiple tasks.
An autoencoder ANN was used in bioinformatics, to predict gene ontology annotations and gene-functionrelationships.[169]In medical informatics, deep learning was used to predict sleep quality based on data from wearables[170]and predictions of health complications from electronic health record data.[171]Deep learning has been shown to produce competitive results in medical application such as cancer cellclassification, lesion detection, organ segmentation and image enhancement.[172][173] Modern deep learningtools demonstrate the high accuracy of detecting various diseases and the helpfulness of their use byspecialists to improve the diagnosis efficiency.[174][175]Finding the appropriate mobile audience for mobile advertising is always challenging, since many datapoints must be considered and analyzed before a target segment can be created and used in ad serving byany ad server.[176] Deep learning has been used to interpret large, many-dimensioned advertising datasets.
Many data points are collected during the request/serve/click internet advertising cycle. This informationcan form the basis of machine learning to improve ad selection.
Customer relationship managementRecommendation systemsBioinformaticsMedical image analysisMobile advertisingImage restorationDeep learning has been successfully applied to inverse problems such as denoising, super-resolution,inpainting, and film colorization.[177] These applications include learning methods such as "ShrinkageFields for Effective Image Restoration"[178] which trains on an image dataset, and Deep Image Prior, whichtrains on the image that needs restoration.
Deep learning is being successfully applied to financial fraud detection, tax evasion detection,[179] and anti-money laundering.[180] A potentially impressive demonstration of unsupervised learning as prosecution offinancial crime is required to produce training data.
Also of note is that while the state of the art model in automated financial crime detection has existed forquite some time, the applications for deep learning referred to here dramatically under perform muchsimpler theoretical models. One such, yet to be implemented model, the Sensor Location Heuristic andSimple Any Human Detection for Financial Crimes (SLHSAHDFC), is an example.
The model works with the simple heuristic of choosing where it gets its input data. By placing the sensorsby places frequented by large concentrations of wealth and power and then simply identifying any livehuman being, it turns out that the automated detection of financial crime is accomplished at very highaccuracies and very high confidence levels. Even better, the model has shown to be extremely effective atidentifying not just crime but large, very destructive and egregious crime. Due to the effectiveness of suchmodels it is highly likely that applications to financial crime detection by deep learning will never be able tocompete.
The United States Department of Defense applied deep learning to train robots in new tasks throughobservation.[181]Physics informed neural networks have been used to solve partial differential equations in both forward andinverse problems in a data driven manner.[182] One example is the reconstructing fluid flow governed bythe Navier-Stokes equations. Using physics informed neural networks does not require the often expensivemesh generation that conventional CFD methods relies on.[183][184]Image reconstruction is the reconstruction of the underlying images from the image-related measurements.
Several works showed the better and superior performance of the deep learning methods compared toanalytical methods for various applications, e.g., spectral imaging [185] and ultrasound imaging.[186]Epigenetic clockFor more information, see Epigenetic clock.

Galkin et al. used deep neuralnetworks to train an epigenetic aging clock of unprecedented accuracy using >6,000 blood samples. Theclock uses information from 1000 CpG sites and predicts people with certain conditions older than healthycontrols: IBD, frontotemporal dementia, ovarian cancer, obesity. The aging clock is planned to be releasedfor public use in 2021 by an Insilico Medicine spinoff company Deep Longevity.
Deep learning is closely related to a class of theories of brain development (specifically, neocorticaldevelopment) proposed by cognitive neuroscientists in the early 1990s.[187][188][189][190] Thesedevelopmental theories were instantiated in computational models, making them predecessors of deeplearning systems. These developmental models share the property that various proposed learning dynamicsin the brain (e.g., a wave of nerve growth factor) support the self-organization somewhat analogous to theneural networks utilized in deep learning models. Like the neocortex, neural networks employ a hierarchyof layered filters in which each layer considers information from a prior layer (or the operatingenvironment), and then passes its output (and possibly the original input), to other layers. This processyields a self-organizing stack of transducers, well-tuned to their operating environment. A 1995 descriptionstated, "...the infant's brain seems to organize itself under the influence of waves of so-called trophic-factors... different regions of the brain become connected sequentially, with one layer of tissue maturing beforeanother and so on until the whole brain is mature."[191]A variety of approaches have been used to investigate the plausibility of deep learning models from aneurobiological perspective. On the one hand, several variants of the backpropagation algorithm have beenproposed in order to increase its processing realism.[192][193] Other researchers have argued thatunsupervised forms of deep learning, such as those based on hierarchical generative models and deep beliefnetworks, may be closer to biological reality.[194][195] In this respect, generative neural network modelshave been related to neurobiological evidence about sampling-based processing in the cerebral cortex.[196]Although a systematic comparison between the human brain organization and the neuronal encoding indeep networks has not yet been established, several analogies have been reported. For example, thecomputations performed by deep learning units could be similar to those of actual neurons[197] and neuralpopulations.[198] Similarly, the representations developed by deep learning models are similar to thosemeasured in the primate visual system[199] both at the single-unit[200] and at the population[201] levels.
Facebook's AI lab performs tasks such as automatically tagging uploaded pictures with the names of thepeople in them.[202]Google's DeepMind Technologies developed a system capable of learning how to play Atari video gamesusing only pixels as data input. In 2015 they demonstrated their AlphaGo system, which learned the gameof Go well enough to beat a professional Go player.[203][204][205] Google Translate uses a neural networkto translate between more than 100 languages.
In 2017, Covariant.ai was launched, which focuses on integrating deep learning into factories.[206]As of 2008,[207] researchers at The University of Texas at Austin (UT) developed a machine learningframework called Training an Agent Manually via Evaluative Reinforcement, or TAMER, which proposednew methods for robots or computer programs to learn how to perform tasks by interacting with a humaninstructor.[181] First developed as TAMER, a new algorithm called Deep TAMER was later introduced in2018 during a collaboration between U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) and UT researchers. DeepRelation to human cognitive and brain developmentCommercial activityTAMER used deep learning to provide a robot the ability to learn new tasks through observation.[181]Using Deep TAMER, a robot learned a task with a human trainer, watching video streams or observing ahuman perform a task in-person. The robot later practiced the task with the help of some coaching from thetrainer, who provided feedback such as “good job” and “bad job.”[208]Deep learning has attracted both criticism and comment, in some cases from outside the field of computerscience.
A main criticism concerns the lack of theory surrounding some methods.[209] Learning in the most commondeep architectures is implemented using well-understood gradient descent. However, the theory surroundingother algorithms, such as contrastive divergence is less clear. (e.g., Does it converge? If so, how fast? Whatis it approximating?) Deep learning methods are often looked at as a black box, with most confirmationsdone empirically, rather than theoretically.[210]Others point out that deep learning should be looked at as a step towards realizing strong AI, not as an all-encompassing solution. Despite the power of deep learning methods, they still lack much of thefunctionality needed for realizing this goal entirely. Research psychologist Gary Marcus noted:"Realistically, deep learning is only part of the larger challenge of building intelligentmachines. Such techniques lack ways of representing causal relationships (...) have no obviousways of performing logical inferences, and they are also still a long way from integratingabstract knowledge, such as information about what objects are, what they are for, and howthey are typically used. The most powerful A.I. systems, like Watson (...) use techniques likedeep learning as just one element in a very complicated ensemble of techniques, ranging fromthe statistical technique of Bayesian inference to deductive reasoning."[211]In further reference to the idea that artistic sensitivity might be inherent in relatively low levels of thecognitive hierarchy, a published series of graphic representations of the internal states of deep (20-30 layers)neural networks attempting to discern within essentially random data the images on which they weretrained[212] demonstrate a visual appeal: the original research notice received well over 1,000 comments,and was the subject of what was for a time the most frequently accessed article on The Guardian's[213]website.
Some deep learning architectures display problematic behaviors,[214] such as confidently classifyingunrecognizable images as belonging to a familiar category of ordinary images (2014)[215] andmisclassifying minuscule perturbations of correctly classified images (2013).[216] Goertzel hypothesizedthat these behaviors are due to limitations in their internal representations and that these limitations wouldinhibit integration into heterogeneous multi-component artificial general intelligence (AGI)architectures.[214] These issues may possibly be addressed by deep learning architectures that internallyform states homologous to image-grammar[217] decompositions of observed entities and events.[214]Criticism and commentTheoryErrorsLearning a grammar (visual or linguistic) from training data would be equivalent to restricting the system tocommonsense reasoning that operates on concepts in terms of grammatical production rules and is a basicgoal of both human language acquisition[218] and artificial intelligence (AI).[219]As deep learning moves from the lab into the world, research and experience show that artificial neuralnetworks are vulnerable to hacks and deception.[220] By identifying patterns that these systems use tofunction, attackers can modify inputs to ANNs in such a way that the ANN finds a match that humanobservers would not recognize. For example, an attacker can make subtle changes to an image such that theANN finds a match even though the image looks to a human nothing like the search target. Suchmanipulation is termed an “adversarial attack.”[221]In 2016 researchers used one ANN to doctor images in trial and error fashion, identify another's focal pointsand thereby generate images that deceived it. The modified images looked no different to human eyes.
Another group showed that printouts of doctored images then photographed successfully tricked an imageclassification system.[222] One defense is reverse image search, in which a possible fake image is submittedto a site such as TinEye that can then find other instances of it. A refinement is to search using only parts ofthe image, to identify images from which that piece may have been taken.[223]Another group showed that certain psychedelic spectacles could fool a facial recognition system intothinking ordinary people were celebrities, potentially allowing one person to impersonate another. In 2017researchers added stickers to stop signs and caused an ANN to misclassify them.[222]ANNs can however be further trained to detect attempts at deception, potentially leading attackers anddefenders into an arms race similar to the kind that already defines the malware defense industry. ANNshave been trained to defeat ANN-based anti-malware software by repeatedly attacking a defense withmalware that was continually altered by a genetic algorithm until it tricked the anti-malware while retainingits ability to damage the target.[222]In 2016, another group demonstrated that certain sounds could make the Google Now voice commandsystem open a particular web address, and hypothesized that this could "serve as a stepping stone for furtherattacks (e.g., opening a web page hosting drive-by malware)."[222]In “data poisoning,” false data is continually smuggled into a machine learning system's training set toprevent it from achieving mastery.[222]Most Deep Learning systems rely on training and verification data that is generated and/or annotated byhumans. It has been argued in media philosophy that not only low-paid clickwork (e.g. on AmazonMechanical Turk) is regularly deployed for this purpose, but also implicit forms of human microwork thatare often not recognized as such.[224] The philosopher Rainer Mühlhoff distinguishes five types of"machinic capture" of human microwork to generate training data: (1) gamification (the embedding ofannotation or computation tasks in the flow of a game), (2) "trapping and tracking" (e.g. CAPTCHAs forimage recognition or click-tracking on Google search results pages), (3) exploitation of social motivations(e.g. tagging faces on Facebook to obtain labeled facial images), (4) information mining (e.g. by leveragingquantified-self devices such as activity trackers) and (5) clickwork.[224]Cyber threatReliance on human microworkMühlhoff argues that in most commercial end-user applications of Deep Learning such as Facebook's facerecognition system, the need for training data does not stop once an ANN is trained. Rather, there is acontinued demand for human-generated verification data to constantly calibrate and update the ANN. Forthis purpose Facebook introduced the feature that once a user is automatically recognized in an image, theyreceive a notification. They can choose whether of not they like to be publicly labeled on the image, or tellFacebook that it is not them in the picture.[225] This user interface is a mechanism to generate "a constantstream of verification data"[224] to further train the network in real-time. As Mühlhoff argues, involvementof human users to generate training and verification data is so typical for most commercial end-userapplications of Deep Learning that such systems may be referred to as "human-aided artificialintelligence".[224]Applications of artificial intelligenceComparison of deep learning softwareCompressed sensingDifferentiable programmingEcho state networkList of artificial intelligence projectsLiquid state machineList of datasets for machine-learning researchReservoir computingScale space and deep learningSparse coding1.
